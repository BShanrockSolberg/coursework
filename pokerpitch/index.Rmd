## Hand Value in Stud Poker - the Key to Victory

### Basic Poker Strategy -  requires accurate Hand Value estimation
* My Hand:  How good is my hand already, and what are the odds of making it better?
* Expense:  Is my hand good enough to put more money in the pot and draw another card?  
* Other Hands:  Are any hands either already better or likely to beat me if they keep drawing?
* Stud Poker's 4-5 betting rounds & visible cards leaves more scope for skill 
than [Draw Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_poker)

### What affects Hand Value?
* [5 card stud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Card_Stud) wins with much weaker hands 
than  [7 card stud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-card_stud)
or [Texas Hold-Em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em)
* In a professional/casino game, # of players can shift suddenly, wildcards are banned
* in a private "friendly" game, # of wildcards can shift suddenly, but players are fixed
* The [Hold Them or Fold Them](https://solbergb.shinyapps.io/pokerapp) application explores
how Stud Poker hand values change

## Example: Testing Hand Value by Game 
[Hold Them or Fold Them](https://solbergb.shinyapps.io/pokerapp)
tests [5 card stud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Card_Stud) 
vs  [Texas Hold-Em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em) with 4 players
and 0 wildcards.
